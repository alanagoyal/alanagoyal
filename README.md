# [notes](https://alanagoyal.com/notes)

i'm obsessed with re-creating apple products. this one is a notes-inspired website that doubles as my personal website.

## how it works

### architecture

the app uses a session-based architecture with two types of notes:

**public notes**: viewable by everyone, managed by the site owner. these appear on the public site and in the sidebar for all visitors.

**private notes**: anyone can create and view their own private notes. each browser session gets a unique session id (stored in localstorage) that links to the notes you create. only you can see and edit your private notes.

the app is built with:
- **next.js 14** with app router for server-side rendering and static generation
- **typescript** for type safety
- **supabase** for database and authentication
- **react-markdown** with github flavored markdown support
- **tailwind css** for styling

### backend

the app uses [supabase](https://supabase.com) for the postgresql database with row-level security policies to control access to public and private notes.

**database schema**:

the `notes` table stores all notes with these fields:
- `id` (uuid): unique identifier
- `title` (text): note title
- `content` (text): markdown content
- `session_id` (uuid): links notes to browser sessions
- `public` (boolean): controls visibility
- `slug` (text): url-friendly identifier
- `category` (text): optional categorization
- `emoji` (text): note icon
- `created_at` (timestamp): when the note was created

### caching

public notes are cached for 24 hours using next.js isr. private notes are always real-time.

**to manually revalidate public notes**:

set `REVALIDATE_TOKEN` in environment variables, then:

```bash
# revalidate sidebar (when adding/removing public notes)
curl -X POST "https://yourdomain.com/notes/revalidate" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-revalidate-token: your-token" \
  -d '{"layout": true}'

# revalidate specific note (when updating content)
curl -X POST "https://yourdomain.com/notes/revalidate" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-revalidate-token: your-token" \
  -d '{"slug": "note-slug"}'
```

or redeploy on vercel to refresh all pages.

for a deep dive into the architecture, data flow, and implementation details, see [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md).

### performance and optimization

this app has been analyzed for performance bottlenecks and optimization opportunities. key findings include:

**current architecture strengths**:
- incremental static regeneration (isr) for public notes with 1-hour cache
- session-based architecture with localStorage for client state
- granular rpc functions for secure database operations

**identified bottlenecks**:
- duplicate data fetches in note pages (metadata + render)
- root layout fetches all public notes on every request
- excessive refetching after note updates
- complex sidebar component with many state variables

**recommended improvements**:
- use react `cache()` to deduplicate note fetches (50% query reduction)
- add layout caching (5-minute revalidation instead of 0)
- implement optimistic updates for smoother ux
- consolidate rpc functions for atomic updates
- split sidebar into smaller, focused components
- add lazy loading for heavy components (command menu, emoji picker)

see [PERFORMANCE_IMPROVEMENTS.md](./PERFORMANCE_IMPROVEMENTS.md) for detailed optimization proposals with implementation plans, priority rankings, and expected impact.

## clone the repo

`git clone https://github.com/alanagoyal/alanagoyal`

## set up the database

this project uses [supabase](https://supabase.com) as a backend. to set up the database:

1. create a [new project](https://database.new) and enter your project details
2. wait for the database to launch
3. navigate to the sql editor in the dashboard
4. paste the sql from the [migration file](https://github.com/alanagoyal/alanagoyal/blob/main/supabase/migrations) into the sql editor and press run

alternatively, use the supabase cli to run migrations locally:
```bash
supabase db push
```

grab the project url and anon key from the api settings and put them in a new `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL="<your-supabase-url>"
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="<your-anon-key>"
```

## install dependencies

`npm install`

## run the app

run the application in the command line and it will be available at http://localhost:3000.

`npm run dev`

## deploy

deploy using [vercel](https://vercel.com)

## markdown syntax for notes

notes support github flavored markdown (gfm) with interactive features. here's what you can use:

### headings

```markdown
# heading 1
## heading 2
### heading 3
```

### text formatting

```markdown
**bold text**
*italic text*
~~strikethrough~~
`inline code`
```

### lists

**unordered lists**:
```markdown
- item one
- item two
  - nested item
  - another nested item
```

**ordered lists**:
```markdown
1. first item
2. second item
3. third item
```

### task lists (interactive)

task lists are interactive - click checkboxes to toggle completion:

```markdown
- [ ] task to do
- [x] completed task
- [ ] another task
```

the app automatically updates the markdown when you click checkboxes, so your progress is saved.

### tables

create tables using standard markdown table syntax. tables render with a styled dark theme:

```markdown
| book | author | year read |
|------|--------|-----------|
| the great gatsby | f. scott fitzgerald | 2023 |
| 1984 | george orwell | 2024 |
```

this renders as:

| book | author | year read |
|------|--------|-----------|
| the great gatsby | f. scott fitzgerald | 2023 |
| 1984 | george orwell | 2024 |

**table features**:
- white borders on dark background
- properly padded cells
- header row styling
- responsive layout
- supports links in cells

### links

```markdown
[link text](https://example.com)
```

all links automatically open in new tabs for better navigation.

### code blocks

**inline code**: use backticks for `inline code`

**code blocks**: use triple backticks for multi-line code
````markdown
```javascript
function hello() {
  console.log("hello world");
}
```
````

### blockquotes

```markdown
> this is a blockquote
> it can span multiple lines
```

### images

```markdown
![alt text](image-url.jpg)
```

### horizontal rules

```markdown
---
```
